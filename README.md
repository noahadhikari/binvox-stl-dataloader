# binvox-stl-dataloader

## Description

The download script for the folders is `download_all_models.py` and for the ratings is `get_all_ratings.py`.

All of the folders to be downloaded are located in the Python dictionary `ALL_FILE_FOLDERS`. Add additional folders with their folderIds to download them. Please try to name the key appropriately if possible, and feel free to comment out the ones that have already been downloaded.

Assumes the binvox folder contains the string "Binvox" and the stl folder contains the string "rotated".

## Setup

If on Windows, you will need to install [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).

To begin, open Git Bash, `cd` into whatever folder you'd like to clone the repository and run `git clone https://github.com/noahadhikari/binvox-stl-dataloader.git`. Open this folder in VSCode or a similar editor.

You'll also need to create a `.env` file in your root directory and copy-paste from the `.env-template` file (ignoring the braces):

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY = {your api key here}
```

### Acquiring Google credentials

Follow the steps in the quickstart here and see if you can get `quickstart.py` working: https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/python

This will set up the environment expected for `download_all_models.py`.

NOTE: You may need to do the following steps before `quickstart.py` will work.

Change the port on the line `creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)` to be `port=8080` instead of `port=0`. Then do the following.

You'll also need to create an OAuth client ID and add the following to its Authorized JavaScript origins (unsure of how many of these are necessary):
- http://localhost
- https://model-rating.vercel.app
- http://localhost:8080

and the following to Authorized redirect URIs:
- http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
- https://model-rating.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google
- http://localhost
- http://localhost:8080/

### Modifying scopes

After successfully running `quickstart.py`, delete `token.json` and you should be able to run `download_all_models.py`. This will update the token to have download-access (the quickstart only allows read access).

### Python dependencies
- tqdm
- google-api-client

The google package should be installed after running the quickstart. To install tqdm, run
```
pip install tqdm
```
from the command line.
